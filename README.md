# PythonAudioBookFromPdf
This script will generate an audio book from the pdf. You can add your own pdf file by replacing just one line of code. And in for loop you can change the start page number, this 
script will start from page 8,as in my case I want to be read from page 8. That's why I used index 7.You can change as per your need.
